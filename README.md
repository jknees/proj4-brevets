##ACP controle times
That's "controle" with an 'e', because it's French, although "control" is also accepted. Controls are points where
a rider must obtain proof of passage, and control[e] times are the minimum and maximum times by which the rider must
arrive at the location.

The algorithm for calculating controle times is described at https://rusa.org/octime_alg.html . The description is ambiguous, but the examples help. Part of finishing this project is clarifying anything that is not clear about the requirements, and documenting it clearly.

We are essentially replacing the calculator at https://rusa.org/octime_acp.html . We can also use that calculator to clarify requirements and develop test data.
